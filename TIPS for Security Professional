MOST IMPORTANT TIPS (Read First)
✅ 1️⃣ Strong Fundamentals Beat Tools

Learn Networking (TCP/IP, DNS, HTTP, ports)

Understand Linux & Windows internals

Know how attacks work, not just tool buttons

👉 Interview truth: Tools change, fundamentals don’t.

✅ 2️⃣ Think Like an Attacker, Act Like a Defender

Learn common attack paths (phishing → malware → lateral movement)

Map incidents to MITRE ATT&CK

Ask: How did this happen? What’s next?

✅ 3️⃣ Log Analysis is KING 👑

Practice reading real logs (firewall, auth, web, syslog)

Understand timestamps, IPs, user agents, event IDs

Correlate events across systems

👉 SOC without log skills = blind SOC

✅ 4️⃣ Don’t Memorize Alerts — Understand Them

Don’t say: “High severity alert”

Say: “Multiple failed logins followed by a successful login from a new geo → possible brute force”

✅ 5️⃣ Always Follow a Process

Learn & follow:

Incident lifecycle: Detect → Analyze → Contain → Eradicate → Recover → Lessons Learned

Escalation matrix & SLAs

Interviewers LOVE process-oriented answers.

🛠️ PRACTICAL CAREER TIPS
✅ 6️⃣ Build Hands-on Labs (Mandatory)

Practice on home lab / VMs

Try phishing analysis, brute-force logs, malware hash checks

Document what you did (GitHub or notes)

✅ 7️⃣ Write Everything You Do

Good documentation = good analyst

Incident notes must answer:

What happened?

When?

Impact?

Action taken?

✅ 8️⃣ Learn at Least ONE SIEM Well

Any SIEM is fine

Focus on:

Log ingestion

Correlation rules

Alert tuning

Dashboards

✅ 9️⃣ Learn Linux First, Then Windows

Linux logs are everywhere in SOC

Commands like grep, awk, journalctl, ss, netstat are daily-use

✅ 🔟 Don’t Ignore Soft Skills

Clear communication during incidents

Write simple, non-technical summaries for management

Stay calm during high-severity incidents
