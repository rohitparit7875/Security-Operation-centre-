Step 1: Map Your Existing Skills (Very Important)

Operations Engineer skills → SOC relevance

Your Ops Skill	How it Helps in SOC

Linux / Windows server monitoring	Log analysis & alert investigation
Networking (IP, ports, DNS)	Detect attacks, suspicious traffic
Incident handling / tickets	SOC incident response process
Firewalls / servers	Security alerts & access control
Shift-based work	SOC works 24×7


👉 Good news: You don’t start from zero.

Step 3: Log Analysis Skills (Very Important)

Learn to analyze:

Windows Logs: Security, System, Event ID (4624, 4625)

Linux Logs: /var/log/auth.log, /var/log/syslog

Firewall logs: allow/deny, source/destination IP


👉 Practice with:

Splunk free

Microsoft Sentinel labs

TryHackMe (SOC paths)

Step 4: Hands-On Practice (This Gets You Hired)

Best Platforms

TryHackMe → SOC Level 1 path

Blue Team Labs Online

LetsDefend (SOC simulation)


💡 Employers value hands-on labs more than theory.

Step 5: Certifications (Choose Smartly)

Best for your transition:

1. ✅ CompTIA Security+ (foundation)


2. ✅ Blue Team Level 1 (BTL1) – highly respected


3. CEH (optional, not mandatory)



If budget is low → focus on labs + Security+.
